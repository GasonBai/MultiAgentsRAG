# MultiAgentsRAG

Welcome to the MultiAgentsRAG repository, where we're tackling the intriguing challenge of fact-conflict hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs) with a dash of humor. Brace yourselves for experiments that not only demystify the realm of LLMs but also venture into the financial domain, because who says data can't be fun?

## About The Experiment 🧪

We're on a mission to reduce the "daydreaming" of LLMs by:

1. **Fine-tuning Fun**: Utilizing FiQA as our fine-tuning playground, we've put two base models, Llama2-7b and ChatGLM2-6b, through their paces. With the help of LoRA, they're learning to stick to the facts.

2. **Benchmarking Bonanza**: We're leveraging the robust evaluation Benchmarks - MMLU, HaluEval, and TruthfulQA - because testing our models should be as exciting as a game show.

## Training Time 🏋️‍♀️

Get your models into shape by:

1. **Baseline Bootcamp**: Start with the basics. No fancy footwork here, just good old-fashioned training to set the stage.

2. **Expert Extravaganza**: Ready for the big leagues? Multi-Agents Debate (MAD) and Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) are where it's at. We're doubling the agents and doubling the fun (limited by our computational diet, of course).

## The RAGtag Strategy 📚

For RAG:

- We've got reranking strategies that would make a librarian jealous.
- Query rewriting tactics that turn a simple search into a treasure hunt for relevant documents.

## Evaluation Escapades 🎯

Scoring? Sampling? We do it all, and with style. Evaluating model output isn't just about the numbers; it's about the narrative.

Join us on this computational caper as we fine-tune, train, and transform the world of LLMs—one fact at a time.

## How To Contribute?

Want to join the ranks of factual wizards? Here's how you can cast your spell in the MultiAgentsRAG world:

1. **Fork it**: Just like wielding a magic wand, but with code.
2. **Create your feature branch**: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. **Commit your changes**: `git commit -am 'Add some magic'`
4. **Push to the branch**: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. **Submit a pull request**: And watch the factual magic unfold.

## Acknowledgments 🙌

- Hat tip to anyone who's code was used.
- Endless gratitude to coffee, the fuel for our late-night coding sessions.
- And of course, our supporters who believe in the power of factual AI.

Remember, in the world of MultiAgentsRAG, facts are more than just statements; they're an adventure. 🚀
