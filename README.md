# Financial Fact-Checker LLM 🚀

Welcome to the repository where we apply the wisdom of the financial world to the wits of Large Language Models (LLMs)! 🎩💼

## What's the Deal? 🤔
In a nutshell, we're enhancing LLMs to stop them from fabricating facts, especially in the financial domain. Think of it as teaching LLMs to be honest bankers. 🏦✅

## Highlights 🌟
- **Fact-Conflict Hallucination Mitigation**: Like ghostbusters, but for data! We make sure LLMs don't get 'creative' with facts. 🚫👻
- **Multi-Agent Debates**: Our LLMs argue to get to the truth, kind of like a model United Nations for AI. 🤖🌐
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: We don't just rely on what the LLMs know; we let them do some research too! 📚➡️🧠

## The Journey 🛤️
1. **Fine-tuning Fiesta**: We've spiced up our LLMs with a financial data diet to get them ready for the Wall Street of AI. 🌶️💹
2. **Debate Club**: Our models engage in rigorous debates to refine their outputs, ensuring they stick to the facts. 🗣️🏆
3. **Knowledge Quest**: By leveraging external databases, our models can fact-check themselves against the latest financial info. 🔍📈

## How to Use 🧑‍💻
Check out our setup guide and let your LLMs hit the gym with our training regimen. It's like a financial boot camp but for AI. 💪🏋️‍♂️
