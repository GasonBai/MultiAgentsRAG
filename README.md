# The Financial Fact-Checkers League 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️

**Welcome to the league of extraordinary models, where finance meets fact, and hallucinations meet their match.**

## Mission: Fact-Conflict Resolution 🌍

Are you tired of LLMs that think a bull market refers to a farmer's livestock sale? So were we! That's why we've assembled a team of finely-tuned, instruction-following financial wizards, ready to demystify the hallucinations that often befuddle lesser models.

## The Game Plan 📈

1. **Fine-Tuning Fiesta**: We crammed our models' brains with the finest financial datasets — think of it as a brain-food buffet of FiQA and WealthAlpaca.

2. **Multi-Agent Mingle**: Our agents debate over financial facts like it's an Oxford Union showdown, ensuring only the best responses emerge victorious.

3. **RAG Tag Team**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is our secret sauce, adding a pinch of external knowledge to spice up our models' replies.

4. **Benchmark Bonanza**: We've put our models through the wringer with the likes of MMLU, HaluEval, and TruthfulQA. It's like the Olympics for language models, and we're going for gold!

## How to Whip Up Your Own Fact-Checker 🍲

If you're itching to train your own financial guru:

1. **Grab the Code**: Clone this repository and bask in the glory of advanced machine learning.

2. **Prepare the Ingredients**: You'll need the datasets, a sprinkle of patience, and a dash of computational power.

3. **Stir Gently**: Follow our instructions to mix all components. Warning: Do not overmix, or you may end up with an overfitting soufflé.

4. **Let It Simmer**: Train your models with the care of a Michelin-starred chef.

5. **Taste Test**: Evaluate your creation with our benchmarks to ensure it's a Michelin-worthy fact-checker.

## Contribute to the Cause 🤝
