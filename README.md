# Financial Language Models for Reducing Hallucinations 💡

## Introduction 🚀

Welcome to our project repository, where we aim to address the challenge of fact-conflict hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) with a focus on the financial domain. Our approach integrates innovative techniques like Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the factuality of LLM outputs.

## Project Overview 📊

- **Hallucination Mitigation**: Tackling financial fact-conflict hallucinations with our novel framework.
- **MAS Debates**: Implementing a debate framework within MAS to improve reasoning and accuracy.
- **RAG**: Leveraging up-to-date external knowledge to inform and refine the language model responses.
- **Financial Expertise**: Fine-tuning our models with rich financial datasets for domain-specific expertise.

## Dataset 📁

We utilize diverse financial datasets including FiQA and WealthAlpaca, equipping our models with robust financial knowledge.

## Methodology 🛠️

1. **Instruction-Tuning**: Leveraging instruction-tuning to enhance the financial acumen of our models.
2. **MAS Integration**: Orchestrating debates among agents to critique and refine responses.
3. **RAG Workflow**: Incorporating a custom retrieval engine to supplement model responses with external knowledge.

## Results 📈

Our system demonstrates significant improvements in reducing hallucinations, outperforming traditional models in benchmarks like TruthfulQA and HaluEval.

## Usage 🖥️

Follow our setup guide to train and evaluate the models. We provide comprehensive instructions for replicating our experiments and utilizing our framework.
